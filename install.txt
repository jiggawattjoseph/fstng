Installation:
Upload the .zip file named FSTNG to using the "Add New" -> "Upload Plugin" buttons on the Plugins page of the Wordpress Dashboard.  Be sure to 'activate' the plugin after it has been uploaded.

Shortcode:
To add the FSTNG plugin to a page, use the FSTNG Settings page on the WP Dashboard to access the shortcode configuration menu.  Use the checkboxes to select categories of adjectives and nouns to display on the page.  You can select different options to be displayed on different pages, which allows you to create random name generators for different sports.  We recommended that you choose an equal number of adjectives and nouns to be displayed on any given instance.  
 
After making your category selections from the menu, hit the submit button, and a ‘script’ consisting of several blocks of shortcode will be displayed in the output box to the right.
 
Copy and paste the shortcode blocks into the page content, using the 'text' view. For example: 

	[display_formFieldsTop] 
	[fstng_adj_00] [fstng_adj_01] [fstng_adj_02] [fstng_adj_03]
	[display_formFieldsMid] 
	[fstng_noun_00] [fstng_noun_02] [fstng_noun_04] [fstng_noun_05]
	[display_formFieldsEnd][display_formData]

Once you have copied the shortcode to your page, ‘Save Changes’ and then ‘View Page’ to confirm that the shortcode changes have taken effect. 

Updating Adjectives & Nouns:  
Update the categories and the lists of terms using the FSTNG Settings panel in the WP Dashboard.  For each category, enter a Category Name and then input a list of terms for that category.  The each term in the list must be separated from the others by a comma (,) but quotation marks are unnecessary. When you are finished updating the categories, be sure to click the 'Save Changes' button.
